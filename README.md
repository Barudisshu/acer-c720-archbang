acer-c720-archbang
==================

I installed by creating a pen drive on Windows using Universal USB Installer. In order to get the live CD to boot, I added `mem=1536m` to the boot command, and changed the archiso parameter from `ARCHBANG` to `UUI`. From there I ran the install script as normal.
